# Yield Tokenization Protocol Trading Automation

This repository demonstrates an advanced trading bot developed for interacting with complex DeFi smart contracts on Ethereum, specifically those utilizing a diamond proxy (EIP-2535) architecture.

Key aspects:

- Interacts with multi-layered DeFi smart contracts.
- Successfully integrated with a diamond proxy contract.
- Leveraged AI tools to accelerate development and integration.

This code serves as a proof-of-concept and demonstration of capabilities. Please note that it was developed rapidly for personal use for a specific, short-term use case and the code structure reflects this (it's ugly ;)).
